# The plan:

When beginning the development for this project we thought it would be a good idea to break down the game into a series of subsystems. This way we could pre-plan how we wanted certain systems to interact and would also allow for us to catch systems we had yet to think about. 

Our group wrote the systems onto a board and then once we had agreed on what we should keep we grouped them into 5 categories.

Here is a list of the groups and subsystems:

* Characters/Worms
    * Movement
    * Animations
* Game Functions
    * Camera
    * Level State Machine
    * Replays
    * Game Stats
    * Weapon Crates
* Physics
    * Collisions
    * Wind
    * Gravity
* Terrain
    * Terrain Generation
    * Terrain Deformation
    * Terrain Parallaxing
    * Terrain User Loading
* Weapons
    * Projectiles
    * Grenades
    * Aerial
    * Miscellaneous
    
We then roughly assigned people to one of these categories as there were 5 group members. I chose Terrain as my set of systems to work on and so I've been planning different ways to tackle the problem. My current Idea is to use a Marching Cube approach however I have yet to see how DirectX works so this is almost certain to change.
