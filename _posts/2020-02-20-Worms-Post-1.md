# Introduction

***

For my Game Engine Programming module this year we have been tasked to create a version of the game "Worms" with the DXTK in c++.

We have already created a prototype for how we plan impliment some of our systems by first creating it in Unity (c#). 

My group consists of 5 members including myself so we have plently people to divide and allocate systems too.
