# Starting with Direct X

Now that the c++ project has began we have been provided with a framework for developing our worms game. 

It contains some standard classes as well as several DirectX libs that we can use and base some of our content around. It also contains several examples on how to properly render and handle things. 

This week I have been taking a look and trying to get my head around some of the complicated aspects that this engine brings. The primary struggle that I've had some far is figuring out how to translate the examples I have into 2D and how Im going to attempt my terrain as most of the examples are 3D oriented. 

I've been told that trying to understand everything from the start is probably a bad idea as I wont need to know all aspects of the framework and some of the DXTK will make sense over time as I use it more. 

The team and I have been talking about what we should be doing next, and my terrain stuff is one of the first things that really needs to be done so I will soon need to get something working so my plan as of now is to make test terrain image and try find away get that drawing, then find a way to mess with it.
